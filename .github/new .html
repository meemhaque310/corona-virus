                   </div>
                      <div class="right-div">
<p>Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is an infectious disease caused by a newly discovered coronavirus.

Most people infected with the COVID-19 virus will experience mild to moderate respiratory illness and recover

without requiring special treatment.  Older people, and those with underlying medical problems like cardiovascular 

disease, diabetes, chronic respiratory disease, and cancer are more likely to develop serious illness.

The best way to prevent and slow down transmission is be well informed about the COVID-19 virus, the disease

 it causes and how it spreads. Protect yourself and others from infection by washing your hands or using an 
 
 alcohol based rub frequently and not touching your face. 

The COVID-19 virus spreads primarily through droplets of saliva or discharge from the nose when an

 infected person coughs or sneezes, so it’s important that you also practice respiratory etiquette
 (for example, by coughing into a flexed elbow).

At this time, there are no specific vaccines or treatments for COVID-19. However, there are many

ongoing clinical trials evaluating potential treatments. WHO will continue to provide updated information

 as soon as clinical findings become available.</p>

        <h2>2020 coronavirus pandemic in Bangladesh</h2>

                      <div class="right-div">

<p>The 2019–20 coronavirus pandemic was confirmed to have spread to Bangladesh on March 2020.
 
The first three known cases were reported by the country's Institute of Epidemiology, Disease 

Control and Research (IEDCR) on 7 March 2020.[2] As of 7 April 2020, the Government of Bangladesh

has confirmed testing 3610 samples among which there is a total of 164 confirmed cases, 33 recoveries,
 and 17 deathwatch in the country.[3][4]

Experts criticised that not enough tests were conducted in the country that has a population of over 160 million.

[4][5] Newspaper reports and social media continued to report about additional deaths of patients with COVID-19 symptoms.

 Some of the deceased were treated at COVID-19 isolation centres at hospitals in the districts and others were denied 
 
 treatment, though no tests were conducted to confirm contagion.[6] For a long time, testing was centralised to only 
 
 Institute of Epidemiology, Disease Control and Research (IEDCR) in the capital Dhaka, although patients with symptoms were reported all around the country.[7]

On 22 March, Bangladesh declared a 10-day shut down effective from 26 March to 4 April.[8]

A series of hotline numbers, email address and the Facebook page of the Institute of Epidemiology, Disease Control and Research (IEDCR) are provided for people to contact if they suspect Covid-19 infection or need more information.[9]
